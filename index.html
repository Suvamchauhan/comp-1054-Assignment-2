            <p>Lactofun is one of those candies that send my down memory lane quickly. This was and still is a popular
                candy with a signature taste that no one has been able to replicate so far.LactoFun has a delicious and
                luscious flavour because it is made with premium, creamy milk and tasty caramel aswell as has the
                perfect balance between Sweet and Savory. Children's sweet tooth has been satiated by its delightful
                taste of crunchy caramel and milky goodness for more than 20 years.
